## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6, Part 2

    Lab 6 part 2 is one of my favorite labs because it was a code about one of my favorite games: blackjack. I had to learn about how we could use vectors to store command line inputs which we could use later. This allows the code to find what is the total they have with their two cards.

* Lab 9, Part 1

    Lab 9 part 1 is one of my favorite labs because it was a code about spelling. What I learned from Lab 9 part 1 was how to transfer information into a vector without spaces and next lines. This helps me find out how to use other files while coding.

* Lab 11, Part 1

    Lab 11 part 1 is one of my favorite labs because it was a code that combined everything we have learned and some more by giving out the densest state and sparest state in the United States. What I had learned about how to use classes with both public and private variables. It allowed me to understand how to use classes in the future.
